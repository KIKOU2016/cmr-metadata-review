# Metric Set Class
#
# The metric set class serves as an object that can generate predefined metric functions on an arbitrary set of records
# A MetricSet object is instantiated by providing an array of records as a parameter.
# Then all metrics are generated based on the given record set.
#
# A MetricSet containing the original revision of all records can also be instantiated from an existing MetricSet
# So a MetricSet with all revision "2" records will output a new MetricSet with all revision "1" records from the "original_record_set_function"
